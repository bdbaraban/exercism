Recently I've been working my way through tracks on [exercism.io](./exercism.io).
It's been a great resource for beginning to learn new programming languages
through hands-on practice.

Exercism tracks play out similarly to the project-based learning format I am
familiar with at Holberton School. Tracks start with the basics of each language
and gradually ramp up in intensity, aiming to cover the entire feature-set of a
given language. For each task, Exericsm provides me a function prototype and test
suite, and I am tasked with solving the given algorithm.

Each track features a "core" curriculum. For every task in the core curriculum,
I am not approved to move onto the next one until a mentor has reviewed my code.
Thus far I've found mentors to be incredibly helpful and insightful - for instance,
a mentor in the Rust track helped me greatly make more efficient a pythagorean
triplet algorithm using some algebra and Rust's `filter_map`.

## Tracks

I am currently working on the following language tracks:

* [Rust](./rust)
* [JavaScript](./javascript)
* [TypeScript](./typescript)

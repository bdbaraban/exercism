Exercism ([exercism.io](./exercism.io)) has become my go-to resource for starting to learn and get hands-on practice
with new programming languages.

Language tracks on Exercism play out similarly to the project-based learning format I became comfortable with at [Holberton School](https://holbertonschool.com). Tracks start with the basics of each language and gradually ramp up in intensity, aiming to cover the entire feature-set of the given language. For each task, Exercism provides me a function prototype and test suite, and I am tasked with solving the given algorithm.

Each track features a "core" curriculum. For every task in the core curriculum,
I am not approved to move onto the next one until a mentor has reviewed my code.
Thus far I've found mentors to be incredibly helpful and insightful - for instance,
a mentor in the Rust track helped me greatly make more efficient a pythagorean
triplet algorithm using some algebra and Rust's `filter_map`.

## Tracks

I am currently working on the following language tracks:

* [Rust](./rust)
* [JavaScript](./javascript)
* [TypeScript](./typescript)
